							<p>Users, also called enduser, are the individuals who were not partof the supporting or developing of the product or service.

								<h1><strong>What is Design Thinking?</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>Design thinking can be definedasthe process where we try to understand the user or audience.This processrevolves itself around the development and understandingof the peoplethat developers aim to create work for. There are five stages in design thinkingand they are empathize, define, ideate, prototype,and test. According to the website interaction-design, it is necessary to develop and or enhance skills that could understand the changes in theusers’environmentand behavior.The term design thinking was first mentioned by Herbert Simon in his book “The Sciences of the Artificial.”There are lots of definitions, for design thinking, that can be found on the internet. All of these are true sincethere is nospecificanswer forthis question. Design thinking is a form of strategy to seeing the world. According to IDEO, the design thinking process isn’t a fail-safe approach but it is also not the only approach. But based on the work that they havedone, the process is very effective. It has helped them change how they develop their products and services.</p>

								<h1><strong>Prototyping</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p><strong>What is Prototyping?</strong></p>
							<p>A prototype is an early sample, model or release of a product created to test a concept or process.Typically, a prototype is used to evaluate a new design to improve the accuracy of analysts and system users. It is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea. Prototypesare a crucial part of the design processand a practice used in all design disciplines. From architects, engineers, industrial designers and even service designers, they make their prototypes to test their designs before investing in their mass production.(Ramirez, 2018)</p>
							<p><strong>What is the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes?</strong></p>
							<p>Low-fidelity prototypes are usually drawn on paper and does not allow any user interactions. Low fidelity prototypes are easier and quicker to create. They help developers by giving them an early visualization of design solutions.High-Fidelity prototypes are computerized and allows user interaction.</p>
							<p><strong>Give examples of Low-fidelity and High-fidelity Prototypes</strong></p>
							<p><img src="images/prototype.jpg"width="500" height="300"/></p>
							<p><strong>Why is prototyping important?</strong></p>
							<p>Having a prototype makes it easier to understand the tasks for each team member. It gives them the opportunity to do more realistic planning of development deadlines and more accurately determine the cost of work. Website development in strict accordance with the prototype allows not taking into account the cost of changes and modifications.(Mishra, 2019)</p>
