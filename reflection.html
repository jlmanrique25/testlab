								<h1><strong>My First Weeks of USERDES</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>The first week of this school year was filled with introductions. Introductions usually consisted of a room full of students introducing themselves one by one. This serves as the first time where I had to introduce myself in front of a device, while my classmates and professor listens on the other side using their own devices. USERDES was one of the very few subjects who had an interesting way of introducing students. We were asked about our favorite app, and had to show others why they liked the certain app. My chosen app is an otome game called Obey Me! One master to rule them all. The game used to be just another game that helped me pass the time. USERDES helped me further understand how design is not all about complimenting colors and texts. Design plays a bigrole in attracting users or customers. Since otome games usually cater to the female popularity, Obey Me had to focus on creating characters with different personalities.Otomegames have to take into account the possible personas of the users. Back in senior high, my friends and I chose to create a visual novel app for our app project. Our midterm app is about a guy and his pet dog. We had to take into account the people who might use our app. The personas consisted of dog lovers. Our finals app was my favorite part. As the writer of the story, I had to come up with a story that will catch the attention ofusers. I love reading romance novels. It took me a few weeks to write thestory. The stress was worth its since the story was well received by the panel of judges. I am planning on asking permission from my teammates if I could post our app on my personal website. One of my goals is to create my own visual novel apps. </p>

								<h1><strong>Design Thinking Process</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>It was through this lesson that I realized that there is more to design than I thought.I initially thought that design was about creating works that are visually, appealing and this is mostly true. But for our USERDES class, we found out that User design is important since when designing something.Designers should not focus on what they think is beautiful and creative, but should focus on what their users or customers would find appealing. The design thinking process helpsdevelopers understand their users more and to help determine possible challenges that may arrive. This was a process I wish my team and I had used before. The apps and website I created before were all made based on what my team and I wanted to see. We never had a proper prototype and such. Our beta test even consisted of one of our own members who had little contribution to our project. The design thinking process can be a real eye opener to developers especially if thought at an earlier stage. We were asked to create an website that may serve as our online portfolio. The design thinking process helped me determine how to organize the contents of my website. I determined how others could easily navigate through my site and at the same time find it visually appealing. </p>

								<h1><strong>Need Finding</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>This reflection is about how our group worked together to create a possible solution to certain problems. Our group consisted of 3 members. Amongthe many problemswe had thought of, we chose to go withthetransportation problems that arose this pandemic. Thepandemic has taken a toll on different industriessuch as tourismand public transportations. Since public utility vehicles couldn’t operate with full passenger capacities, both passengers and drivers are affected. Traffic in the Philippines has already been an important topic even before the pandemic happened. Passengers’waiting time has increased and it wasour goal to help lessen the struggle. We had little difficulty when we made the experience map, mostly because everyone in our group frequently used PUVs as a means oftransportationfor getting to school or other locations. This experience sort of helped us when it came to making personas for our prototype. It was also the personas that we had to create storyboards about. I couldn’t do much when it came to the design or prototype. Art was always a difficult subject for me. All I could do was think of how our users couldnavigate through our website. We even decided to create a website at first, but then we realized how it would be better to create an app since it would be easier for commuters to access compared to awebsite.</p>

								<h1><strong>Information Architecture</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>During the discussion on information Architecture, bookworms were asked how they organized their shelves. I thought about how I used to just place them on shelves, not bothering on where the they are placed on the shelf. Now, I like organizing them based on their author and then by which series came first. An example would be my Rick Riordan books. I place all the books written by Rick Riordan in one row. Then organize them by their series. I currently have books from the Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Kane Chronicles, and the Heroes of Olympus series. They are arranged the same as they were previously mentioned.Information Architecture is the process of creating a structure, for Websites or app, that would be useful to users. As explained during our USERDES class, a well-designed AI will help user navigate easily to find the information that they are looking for. I took this into account and was able to divide the documents that I plan on adding to my personal website. There is a personal page that wouldfocus on myaccomplishment. This page may also serve as an online resume, where future employers may learn more about me. The next page would focus on my works. It wouldcontain previous and future projects.Ihave already added one oftheapps that we created back in 12thgrade. Eachwork will have its own webpagethat contains details such as my role in the projectandwhen it was created. It would also talkabout who else workedon the project, to give them the credit that they deserved. Since they talked about how they are also creating their own portfolio. I will ask permission to link their website with mine.Since the website would also contain the assignments we made for class, I will also write blogs about my experiences in the school orgs that I joined. The Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program encourages the student ambassadors to submit 
							the blogs that they have created. I am hoping to passa blog about my experiences in the program, and the knowledge I’ve gathered in Microsoft Learn.</p>

								<h1><strong>Visual Information Design</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>As part of the lesson, we were asked to design an invitation for an after-dinner party. I had to take into account the different details given to us. This partis really tough for me since I am very weak when it comes to using colors and the arrangement of details. I like adding lots of color and details to projects making itharder to create a visually appealing projects. So with the invitation activity, I decided to go minimal with the colors I used. I usedan after-dinnerpicture as a background image and only used black and white for the font color. The font color depends on the area,of the background image, they occupysince there are areas that are darker compared to the rest of the video.I mostly rely on color palette websites such as coolors.com but I still ruin the color scheme by using all of it in a single project. Usually,I would already be satisfied with just using2 to 3 colors given. I will start taking into account the color scheme forfont colors and for the background colors. I may start practicingon my online portfolio. I wish we had this subject back in senior high school. We had to create a website from scratch back then andit would have been helpful to know more tips on visual presentation. I just made my website using my favorite colors which is bluw and used the safest font color which is black and blue. I decided to use only white, blue, and black since this three colors are compatible with each other.</p>

								<h1><strong>Color Theory and Typography</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>The games where very challenging but at the same time was very fun. I enjoyed the second game a lot. I just had trouble with the dropbox logo. No matter how much I retry, I cant seem to get to close. I honestly gave up after a long time. I was starting to question whether it was about the color or the opacity. There were some levels that I aced almost immediately,but it was because I was somewhat familiar with the logos already. I had a difficult time with the triangle game. I didn’t really understand the concept at first. It took me awhile to understand the concept of each side of the triangle.Iam not good when it comes to spaces. I had to really on if I think the sentences looked great or not. I would try to repeat the level whenever I failed to get a 100 score. I still don’t know howto determine the perfect ratioof the spacing, font size, and etc. The first game was slightly interesting sinceIjust focused on the spacing of each letter. I had to retry the levels about once or twice. It was very confusing since if you tried refreshing the page to repeat thegame, it doesn’t return to the first font. Itwill really stay on the font that I last tried. This was confusing since when I tried the same with the other games, it went back to the first level or round. There were some fonts in thegame that I encounteredfor the first time. I don’treally know what to say about the last game since I didn’t finish it. I only played the game to a certainlevel and took a screenshot of my current score. I would have to say that the game is really relevant to the topics since we had to differentiate each font.</p>
